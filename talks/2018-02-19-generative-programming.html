<p>Console emulation needs to stem the difficult balance between optimizing code for stable frame rates and maintaining the complex logic required to emulate the given hardware - any sub tle bug in this system easily manifests in a user-visible glitch. How can modern C++ help?</p>
<p>Using the toolbox of generative programming, we take a look at the system call interface of the 3DS and see how far variadic templates, function reflection, and some metaprogramming w ill get us in terms of bridging the gap between performance, maintainability, and correctness.</p>
<p>This is a beginner-friendly talk - prior knowledge of metaprogramming is not required!</p>
